# Memory cards

## Click the yellow box to start the game. The remaining time is shown, and you need to complete the task within 2 minutes; otherwise the game will be over.

## The brief guide is on the right. When the mouse cursor enters the grey box with a left arrow, the guide will slide to the left to be shown, and the arrow will turn to a right arrow; when the mouse cursor leaves, the guide will slide to the right to be hidden, and the arrow will turn back to a left arrow.

## There are 16 brown areas; on their back there are 8 pairs of pictures. Pictures in the same pair are the same; pictures in different pairs are different. By the way, the brown areas look like chocolate.  

## Click one area, and the angel will turn it over so the picture on the back will be shown. Now you may click another area and get another picture. If those two pictures are the same, you will get a pair of pictures. If they are not, they will be turned over back.   

## Go on clicking to get new pairs of pictures until you get all of them, and you will see congratulations in the yellow box.

## Many thanks to the Tik Tok game Gold Coin Architect as the original inspiration. Many thanks to sleepyeyes, liahchan and Yasai! Their pictures are so beautiful! 

## Today is the Mid-autumn Festival. Have a good day! Have a good autumn!
